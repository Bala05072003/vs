<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with
    human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of
    research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their
    environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined
    goals.[1]</p>
<p>Various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The
    traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language
    processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and
    integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial
    neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon
    psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[4] Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google
    DeepMind and Meta,[5] aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)â€”AI that can complete virtually any
    cognitive task at least as well as a human.</p>
